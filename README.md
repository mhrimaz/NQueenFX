# NQueenFX
Solving N Queen Problem with Genetic Algorithm with the Power of Java 8 Stream API and Jenetics Library<br>

# Encoding
Solution representation for this problem is simple. If we want to show a configuration for 8 queen problem we will use all permutation of <0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7>.
This representation is so simple and for Fitness Function we just need to count total number of diagonal constraint violations.<br>
I just use parallel stream to make things faster.
